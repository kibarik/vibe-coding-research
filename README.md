> **"How to build microservices with just one prompt?"**

# Goal
Conduct experiments in a dedicated /experiment branch, documenting ideas and improvements via GitHub Issues. Iteratively address current challenges and share accumulated findings in the OpenSource community. Within ~100 iterations ‚Äî is to produce a robust base template for launching Cursor projects from scratch. This template will allow a single well-formulated idea from a Project Manager to generate a ready-to-use backend microservice in full compliance with corporate quality standards: code style, task planning, git-flow, pull requests, tests, documentation.

I see great potential in using Cursor for building Proof Of Concept projects. If the product hypothesis is validated, the solution can be handed over to experienced Senior developers for implementation.

## üìå Workflow
### Step 1: Experiment
- Come up with an idea for a project you want to generate  
- Take the base template and start the work  
- Bring the experiment to a tangible result  

### Step 2: Observation
- Add a GitHub Issue with the tag `"idea"`, describing the essence of the idea and the expected outcome  
- Attach a link to the GitHub repository with the experiment (to review what the AI agent did)  
- Propose a plan for how to implement the idea  

### Step 3: Add New Features
- Fork the repository  
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)  
- Make your changes  
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)  
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)  
- Open a Pull Request

## Frontend Development
- **MVP Development Workflow**:
  - **Start with HTML**: Every application MVP, regardless of its final platform (e.g., mobile app), should begin as a basic HTML page. This enables rapid prototyping and iteration.
  - **Styling Guidelines**: If you provide a `design.json` file, I will use it as the primary guideline for all styling and visual design choices.

## Testing Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Adopt a TDD approach where possible. At a minimum, ensure that unit tests are created or updated for any new or modified code.
- **Test Completion**: All tests must be passing before a coding task is considered complete.
- **Test Output**: All test reports, artifacts, and error logs must be output to a common `tests_output/` directory at the project root.

## Python Environment Management
- **Virtual Environments**: Always use a virtual environment (`venv`) when running Python scripts. Check for an existing `venv` in the current or parent directories before creating a new one. Activate the `venv` before installing packages or executing scripts.
